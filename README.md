### Set Up the Python HTTP Server

#### You can create a simple server using Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing episodes.json. Then run the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

#### This will start a local server at http://localhost:8000. By default, it serves files from the current directory. 
#### You should be able to access your episodes.json file by navigating to http://localhost:8000/episodes.json in your web browser.
